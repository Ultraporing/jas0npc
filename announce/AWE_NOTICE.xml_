[I]Hi all! Sorry for downtime, yesterday AwesomeDL is taken down by blogspot. thatâ€™s take too much time
 to move database and setup new sites so no links are available until now, my apology to all[/I]
 
As the other features get added back to AWEsomeDL.com, I can start to add them back into this addon.
 So you now know.
